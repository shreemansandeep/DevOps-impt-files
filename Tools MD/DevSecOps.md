>> Vulnerabilities can be software bugs, misconfigurations, weak passwords, or outdated software.

Risk:
>> Risk is the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and causing harm. It represents the potential loss or damage.
>> Examples of risks: financial losses, data loss.

Code Analysis::
>> Code analysis involves examining the source code to identify code quality, bugs, security vulnerabilities, and maintainability. It provide insights into the overall health and quality of the software code. It  generate a variety of metrics and reports, including code smells, duplications, security vulnerabilities.
Helps developers and teams to improve code quality and maintain a consistent coding standard.

Code Coverage:
>> it Measures the percentage of code executed by tests. Identifies areas of code that may be untested and Helps ensure that tests cover a sufficient amount of code. It Displays code coverage metrics such as Percentage of lines, Uncovered areas of code that need more testing.

Bug: 
>> A bug is a coding mistake that causes the code to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly.

sql injection: SQL injection is a type of cyberattack that exploits vulnerabilities in web applications that use SQL databases. Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields, tricking the application into executing it and potentially allowing them to steal data, modify or delete information, or even take control of the database server.

Incident management: is a systematic approach to identify unexpected events that disrupt normal operations. such as software glitches, security breaches

Malware bots: These malicious bots are used to harm systems or steal data. These are designed to perform harmful actions and cyberattacks.

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based security service. It helps protect web applications from common web-based attacks by filtering and monitoring HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

Cloudflare is a cloud security platform and content delivery network (CDN) tool that provides services for website security, and performance. 

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) and Cloudflare WAF are both web application firewall solutions that protect websites and applications from cyber threats.

API: is an application programming interface which helps us communication between two different applications.

API GATEWAY: An API gateway is a software layer that acts as a mediator between a client (Front-end app) and a group of backend services. It receives a request from an application user, routes it to one or more backend services, and delivers the data to the user.

AWS PrivateLink: AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between virtual private clouds (VPCs), supported AWS services, and your on-premises networks without exposing your traffic to the public internet.

VPC endpoint: A VPC endpoint is a network component that allows secure connectivity between resources in a VPC and specific AWS services.
